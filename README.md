# Eco-Mapper

A tool for visualizing ecology of fungi using iNaturalist API and Leaflet.js.

## Retrieving iNaturalist Data
Click on an area, then press 'Populate Organisms' to begin requesting fungal observations from the iNaturalist API.

## Visualizing Fungal Ecology
As iNaturalist data is retrieved, dots will appear on the map representing observations with colors corresponding to ecology.
Red is saprotrophic (decayers), yellow is mycorrhizal (mutual associates), purple is pathogenic (diseases), green is lichenaceous (lichens), and cyan is parasitic.
